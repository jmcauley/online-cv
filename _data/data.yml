        Re-joined a team on the ICD-10 transition project to help with the transition from initial software build-out to maturation. Major tasks include re-architecting to scale the system up to handle operational demands involving transformation of 20 million+ records at a time. Performance improvements have been achieved through introduction of parallel task execution, a Pub/Sub queue-processing subsystem, data-structure usage analysis, and key-value NoSql caching. Operational deployment improvements center around more advanced usage of continuous integration, scripted binary deployments, and the introduction of automated database scripting.

        Joined a team at Cambia on a 6-month contract to create a system to manage a multimillion record rule processing system. The system had to migrate rules from a flat data structure to a hierarchical structure while also migrating from ICD-9 codes to ICD-10 codes while maintaining logical equivalence. The code needed to be rearchitected from a single-developer ASP.NET/Winforms code-behind structure to a modern .Net MVC structure with separation of concerns, a modern ORM, and test driven development to allow a growing team of developers to actively work on system in a useful fashion.

Developed internal documentation and training resources and continued role as technical architect as well as leading scrums, managing development assignments and mapping out milestones and deliverables.

        Product utilized C#/.Net MVC for a middle tier with a jQuery-based UI atop a C#/Boo back end providing a scalable state machine-based recursive descent parser. The Boo-based DSL allowed for description of arbitrary customer file formats while efficiently processing tens of thousands of records at a time.
