      details: | 
        Grew the department from 4 to 15 employees in the course of 2 years. During that time, we established a new DevOps build and deployment infrastructure (using Docker and CircleCI), migrated our front end web products to React, and built a microservices architecture backing our API using Goa and Consul. I introduced a number of development process improvements, including feature branching, feature flagging, and integration testing that greatly improved both our velocity and quality. Through these improvements, the company launched a second flagship product, established a track record of consistent delivery, and improved customer trust in quality.
